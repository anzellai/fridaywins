# FridayWins Presentation

## Random project for Kano weekly wins

### Lazy Installation

To install / build this project, first git clone the repository under your GOPATH, or whatever path you want if you don't have Go installed.

If you have Go installed, run:

`make build && make`

If you don't have Go or Dep installed, prebuilt binaries are *fridaywins-*, you just need to build the assets:

`make build`

You may need global *gulp* installed, or export your local *gulp* to path environment.

After that just run the prebuilt / built binary and the web server should run.

Why Go and not Python or Node.JS for such a small and simple server? 
I just like Go's portability, you can build a single binary and run it everywhere, and it's fast.


### Supports

There are no supports for this project, and I'm lazy so don't ask me for any.
